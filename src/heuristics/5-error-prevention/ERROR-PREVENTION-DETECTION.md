üõë Error Prevention Detector (error-prevention-detector.js)

Detects missing undo options, poor error handling, and lack of user-facing feedback in destructive actions and network requests. Supports **Nielsen Heuristic #5: Error Prevention** ‚Äî preventing problems before they occur.

## What the Detector Does
This detector ensures that:
- Modals and dialogs with dangerous wording offer a cancel or go back option
- Custom form fields offer context through labels or hints
- fetch() or axios calls are wrapped with proper error handling
- Catch blocks don‚Äôt just console.log() ‚Äî they should help users, not just developers

## How the Detector Works

### Main Function: `detectErrorPrevention(content)`
```javascript
function detectErrorPrevention(content) {
  const feedback = [];

   // helper functions

  traverse(ast, {
  // detector logic with AST traversal 
  //feedback.push
 });

 return feedback;
}
```

It parses the JSX or JS content using Babel, and traverses the AST to identify error-prone or dangerous patterns that require better UX safety nets.


###  Key Detection Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Confirmation Dialogs | Detects modals with destructive text but missing no/cancel/dismiss/exit options |
| Custom Inputs | Fields like `<Select>` or `<Upload>` must include contextual hints (`aria-label`, `title`, etc.) |
| AJAX Calls | Warns if `fetch()` or axios are used without `.catch()` or `try/catch` |
| Error Handling | Warns if error handlers only log to console and don‚Äôt show user-facing messages |
| Missing Catch Block | Flags try blocks that do not include a catch clause |

### Detection Logic
1. Destructive Text in Dialogs without Cancel
- If modal contains words like ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù, ‚Äúirreversible‚Äù, etc.
- And no cancel or go-back option is rendered
- ‚Üí Warning
2. Fields Missing Context
- Flags `<Select>`, `<Dropdown>`, etc., if they have no title, aria-label, or aria-describedby
3. Network Requests
- Finds `fetch()` and `axios.*()` calls
 - Checks for:
	- Presence of `.catch()` block or try/catch
	- Feedback logic beyond console.log (e.g. `setError()`,` <Error />`, etc.)
4. Try/Catch Analysis
- If `try {}` block has no catch ‚Üí Warning
- If catch only logs errors ‚Üí Warning
- If `.catch()` arrow function has only `console.log()` ‚Üí Warning

## Feedback Example
```
{
  Line 18, 
  Error handler contains only console logs.
  Action: Consider displaying user feedback (e.g. setError, <Error />).
  Why: This provides no feedback to users when an error occurs.

## Why Detector Matters

Preventing errors is likely a matter of reducing burdens on users and guiding them.

- Protects Users from destructive actions they can‚Äôt undo
- Reduces Anxiety when interacting with irreversible UI decisions
- Improves Accessibility by requiring field-level context
- Ensures Feedback is shown to users, not just developers

## Nielsen Heuristic Compliance

**Heuristic #5: Error Prevention**
> "Users are often distracted from the task at hand, so prevent unconscious errors by offering suggestions, utilizing constraints, and being flexible." [nngroup/error-prevention](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/slips/)

This detector helps:
- Prevent user errors through cancel safety nets
- Enforce good error handling practices
- Catch risky areas before they lead to failure

## Technical Details
- Parses JSX/JS using Babel‚Äôs @babel/parser
- Pattern-matches dialog/button and error prone messafe text for destructive or confirmatory language with Regex
