# ðŸ§­ Breadcrumb Detector (`breadcrumb-detector.js`)

Detects missing breadcrumb navigation in key layout or page components to support **Nielsen Heuristic #1: Visibility of System Status**. It ensures users always know where they are in the application hierarchy.

## What the Detector Does

The Breadcrumb Detector analyzes React/JSX code to identify whether core structural components like `<Page>`, `<Main>`, or `<Layout>` include breadcrumb navigation.

Its goal is to ensure users are always aware of their location within the applicationâ€™s hierarchy.

## How the Detector Works

### Main Function: `detectBreadcrumbs(content)`
```javascript
function detectBreadcrumbs(content) {
  const feedback = [];

  // helper functions

  traverse(ast, {
  // detector logic with AST traversal 
  //feedback.push
 });

 return feedback;
}
```

The detector performs a full **AST traversal** of the JSX using **Babel parser** and looks for:

### Key Detection Methods
| Features | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| JSXElement visitor | Traverses all JSX tags and looks for layout-level components (`<Page>`, `<Main>` etc.) |
| `hasBreadcrumb()` | Helper function checks whether a component (or its children) contains a known breadcrumb structure |
| Attribute inspection | Recognizes attributes like `aria-label="breadcrumb"` or `class="breadcrumb-list"`|
| Recursive scan | Inspects deeply nested children inside the JSX tree for breadcrumb-related elements |

### Detection Logic
The detector applies the following checks:

1. Breadcrumb Component Matching
Searches for `<Breadcrumb>`, `<Breadcrumbs>` or similar custom components inside the layout components.

2. AST traversal for JSX elements
Detects JSX elements to find `<Page>`, `<Layout>`, or `<Main>`, and check for children.

3.	Semantic & Accessibility Attributes
Inspects for:
- `aria-label="breadcrumb"`
-	`class="breadcrumb-list"`

4.	Recursive Search
Ensures breadcrumb elements are present even if nested deeply within the componentâ€™s children.

5.	Warning Only If Missing
Breadcrumbs are only flagged as an issue if none of the above are found in relevant page-level components.


## Feedback Example
Hereâ€™s how a detector warning looks when a `<Page>` component is missing a breadcrumb:
```
{
  Line 20, 
  Page component <Main> has no breadcrumb. Add one for proper system status visibility.
  Action: Add <Breadcrumb> component or <nav aria-label='breadcrumb'> near the top.
  Why: Users need to know their location in the app hierarchy.

}
```

## Why Detector Matters
Breadcrumbs are vital for:
- User Orientation
Users immediately understand where they are in the app
- Navigation Efficiency
Quick access to parent or sibling pages
- Reduced Friction
Especially helpful in multi-level or nested views
- Accessibility & Cognitive Load
Crucial for users with memory, vision, or attention difficulties

## Nielsen Heuristic Compliance

**Heuristic #1: Visibility of System Status**
> "Breadcrumbs are an important navigational element that supports wayfinding â€” making users aware of their current location within the hierarchical structure of a website." [nngroup/breadcrumbs](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/breadcrumbs/)

Breadcrumbs fulfill this principle by:
- Providing contextual awareness
- Visually anchoring users in the site hierarchy
- Enabling clear navigation paths

## Technical Details
- Uses Babelâ€™s `@babel/parser` and `@babel/traverse` for JSX parsing
- Applies errorRecovery: true to handle malformed or incomplete files
